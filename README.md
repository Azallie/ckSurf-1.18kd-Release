# ckSurf-1.18kd-Release üåç Replays soon available for 85 tick servers
  Last seen version of a great plugin, server crash fixed.
  No memory leak, no need to fully unload plugin on regular maps.
  Find me / Discuss here: https://forums.alliedmods.net/member.php?u=107052. More info in the included Readme.
  Taking no credit except the fixing part of a good ol' car, see below:
  - Replays related crashs fixed. Trails removed as in other forks, for performance.
  - Player & admin commands related issues fixed. Some rcon commands (client 0) were fuzzy.
  - Weapons and bots management reviewed to avoid errors & maps crashs.
  - Hooks/events updated, plugin now supports any kind of map.
  - Timer handles and client indexes fixed. As for the commands, it was leading to weird situations.

Notes: Now you have colored start speed, a fixed goto command by Headline (see changelog), and a slower HUD timer.  
       I've noticed lighter server weight with this 0.2 secs timer (don't worry for your run, it's only about HUD info.)  
       sm_clear console warning when starting a run is normal and harmless, it's a fix for a checkpoint plugin I needed.  

Thanks to ZZK community and Freak.exe for testing, and support. Thx to Elzi / jonitaikaponi for the original plugin.  
Thanks to Headline for his sm_goto:  https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=2323724

# Install üèÑ
  - Copy cfg/server_example.cfg content to your server.cfg, then upload all files. Keep your own cleaner extension version if it works, as I will not update it.
  - Create a database entry in addons/sourcemod/configs/databases.cfg like so (you should set your user & password):

  - Start the server. Using -tickrate 102.4 parameter in command start line of a csgo surf server is recommended to avoid ramp glitch.
  Also consider using start /AboveNormal like said here: https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=5386-HMJI-5162

# Changelog üëπ
  - 09/06/20: Fixed Bots quota, plugin now doesn't mess with bots IDs. You still need to change map on server start to work perfectly, but you can just wait for second map. Only bonus bot is missing if you start server and don't change the map.
  
  - 08/06/20: Added 'Estimated Start Speed' in player chat. Fixed the timer after going to spectator team (my bad, here).  
  
  - 02/06/20: Fixed ragdoll removal, a lil' translation mistyping, & round end/match start on regular maps.  
  Added a raw "FakeClientCommandEx sm_clear" to prevent cheats whith another checkpoint plugin.  
  Discovered you should not try mp_restartgame on surf_summer (laggy, annoying bot not finding spawn at round start).  
  
  - 16/01/20: Fixed weapon buy on regular maps like de_dust2,  and 'checkSpawns' log error. Plugin uses maps configs (cfg/sourcemod/ckSurf/map_types/) for respawn and round end. ck_autorespawn and ck_round_end are thus obsolete.  
  
  - Note: In plugins/disabled, there is a ckSurf_slh_rev smx file (ckSurf_slnh_rev for non discord users).  
    You can use the this version instead of the regular one, if you have properly set sv_hibernate_when_empty 0 in server.cfg and in server's launch command parameters.  
    It will never check and never change your hibernation status to write data in your database, which I recommend.
