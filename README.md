  Find me / Discuss here: https://forums.alliedmods.net/member.php?u=107052. More info in the included Readme.
  Taking no credit except the fixing part of a good ol' car, see below:
  - Replays related crashs fixed
  - Player & admin commands related issues fixed
  - Weapons and bots management reviewed to avoid errors & map crashs
  - Hooks/events updated, plugin now supports any kind of map
  - Timer handles and client indexes fixed

# Install üèÑ
  - Copy cfg/server_example.cfg content to your server.cfg, then upload all files. Keep your own cleaner extension version if it works, as I will not update it.
  - Create a database entry in addons/sourcemod/configs/databases.cfg like so (you should set your user & password):

  - Start the server. Using -tickrate 102.4 parameter in command start line of a csgo surf server is recommended to avoid ramp glitch.
  Also consider using start /AboveNormal like said here: https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=5386-HMJI-5162

# Changelog
  - 02/06/20: Fixed ragdoll removal, a lil' translation mistyping, & round end/match start on regular maps.  
  Added a raw "FakeClientCommandEx sm_clear" to prevent cheats whith another checkpoint plugin.  
  I should remove comments, be more precise, but hey I needed a lot of tests.  
  Discovered you should not try mp_restartgame on surf_summer (Plugin blocks restart but this map triggers a 2d one)  
  Currently importing this code from htcarnage: https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=2004356  
  Latest results will upload in a couple of days): https://www.casimages.com/i/200603080127813129.png.html
  - 16/01/20: Fixed weapon buy on regular maps like de_dust2,  and 'checkSpawns' log error. Plugin uses maps configs (cfg/sourcemod/ckSurf/map_types/) for respawn and round end. ck_autorespawn and ck_round_end are thus obsolete.
  - Note: In plugins/disabled, there is a ckSurf_slh_rev smx file (ckSurf_slnh_rev for non discord users).  
    You can use the this version instead of the regular one, if you have properly set sv_hibernate_when_empty 0 in server.cfg and in server's launch command parameters.  
    It will never check and never change your hibernation status to write data in your database, which I recommend.
